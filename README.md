# SIRIS-Javeriana
SIRIS is a research pipeline for Sentinel-2 satellite image restoration and super-resolution. It combines cloud detection, temporal gap filling using generative models, and spatial enhancement through deep learning. The project aims to reduce cloud-induced data gaps and improve image detail while maintaining geospatial consistency.
